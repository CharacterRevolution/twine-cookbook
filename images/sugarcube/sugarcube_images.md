# "Images": SugarCube (v2.18)

## Summary

When using SugarCube, images can be displayed through the [image HTML element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/img) and [*url()*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/url) CSS data type when encoded as Base64.

When using an image element, its source is either absolutely or relatively located. An absolute reference starts with HTTP or another protocol; a relative reference describes the location of the image in relation to the webpage.

Because images are external resources, they need to be included with the webpage as Base64-encoded or in another location. While Base64-encoded images can be embedded in a webpage, it also increases its overall size. External images require additional hosting and are included through their reference in CSS (URL) data type or image (SRC) attribute.

Many macros also support [using images](http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/markup.html#images) in Sugarcube and their location can be used within wiki syntax. Base64-encoded images are not supported in wiki image syntax.
