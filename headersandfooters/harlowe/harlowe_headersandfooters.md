# "Headers and Footers": Harlowe (v2.0)

## Summary

"Headers and Footers" demonstrates the use of the ["header" and "footer" passage tags](https://twine2.neocities.org/#passagetag_header). When used in passages, they are either prepended (header) or appended (footer) to every passage. Multiple passages can have the tags and are loaded alphabetically when detected.

## Twee Code

```
:: StoryTitle
Harlowe: Headers and Footers

:: Start
This is content between the header and the footer.

This is the footer!
