# "Cycling Choices": SugarCube (v2.18)

## Summary

"Cycling Choices" demostrates how to create a 'cycling' effect of different choices through clicking on them.

The 'cycles' starts with the use of the [*&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;*](http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/macros.html#macros-include) macro and assumption of *$choicesCount* beginning at the number -1. Within the passage "Cycling", the first 'cycle' begins with testing if the variable *$choices* exists. If it does not, *$choices* and *$choicesCount* are set (created) to their initial values.

Next, *$choicesCount* is then increased by one to the start value of 0 (the first location of an array in SugarCube) and the position of *$choices* is shown based on this.

If the user clicks on the link (created through using the [*&lt;&lt;linkreplace&gt;&gt;*](http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/macros.html#macros-linkreplace) and *&lt;&lt;include&gt;&gt;* macros) again, future 'cycles' test if *$choicesCount* increases beyond the number of values in the *$choices* array and resets it to 0.

At the end of every 'cycle,' the currently selected value is stored in the variable *$cyclingResult* for future access and usage.
