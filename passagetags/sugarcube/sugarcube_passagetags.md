# "CSS and Passage Tags": SugarCube (v2.18)

## Summary

This example shows how to use CSS selectors to style different passages based on how they are tagged. [In SugarCube](http://www.motoslave.net/sugarcube/2/docs/css.html), the tag name is applied to both the *body* and the passage shown. To style different parts, use either the *body* selector or a combination of 'passage' and the tag name.

SugarCube 2.x and later also applies a "data-tags" attribute to the html, body, and .passage elements. These can also be used to style the page at different levels.

## Twee Code

```

/* Style only the inner part of the passage tagged with "grey" */
.passage.grey {
  background: grey;
}

/* Style only the inner part of the passage tagged with "yellow" */
.passage.yellow {
  background: yellow;
  color: black;
}
