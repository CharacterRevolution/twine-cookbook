# "Turn Counter": Harlowe (v2.0)

## Summary

"Turn Counter" demonstrates the use of the *[(history:)](https://twine2.neocities.org/#macro_history)* macro in keeping track of "turns" (number of passages visited).

In this example, the *length* of the array returned by using the *(history:)* macro is compared to its modulo 24 value. Sometimes known as "wrap around," the modulus operator (%) is used to get the remainder of the number of "turns" (passages) divided by 24. This creates a clock where its value shows one of a series of strings representing "morning", "mid-morning", "afternoon", or "night."

By visiting other passages, the turn count is increased and the hour reaches 23 before being reset back to 0 before increasing again.
