# "Moving through a 'dungeon": Harlowe (v2.0)

## Summary

"Moving through a 'dungeon'" uses the <a href="https://twine2.neocities.org/#macro_a">(array:)</a> macro to create a multidimensional array. Movement positions are then tracked through X and Y variables for a grid system. Each movement subtracts or adds to its cooresponding X or Y position and is compared to those same positions within the array. Different directions are shown if movement is possible in that direction.

A map of the array is created by iterating through temporary variables and placing different symbols matching walls, movement spaces, and the player herself.
